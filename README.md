"Florida Man" is a very basic Chrome extension that replaces the name Jeb Bush with the phrase "Florida Man", and Donald Trump with "Ridiculous Man." You can add it to Chrome through this link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/florida-man-he-shall-not/fjfnlgknacipihkceoijaongcodggjnf

I based the replace.js code on the famous "Cloud to Butt" extension found here: https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/blob/master/Source/content_script.js
